<h1> About</h1><br>
<h5>This is such an important year for California.  Riding along with Clinton v. Trump race, Prop 64 is fighting for its spot for many years.  If passed:
<br>
<br>
<p>
<i>
 <b> 

“A "yes" vote supports legalizing recreational marijuana for persons aged 21 years or older under state law and establishing certain sales and cultivation taxes.”
 </p>
</i>
 </b> 

otherwise:
<br>
<br>
<p>
<i>
 <b> 
“A "no" vote opposes this proposal to legalize recreational marijuana under state law and to establish certain sales and cultivation taxes.
</p>
</i>
 </b> 
 
<br>
Currently Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Alaska, and Washington D.C. are the reigning champs and leaders in this new revolution.  California for will able to join them in the ranks as soon as February if prop 64 pass.  If not, this is only a stepping stone into green future.  This has already opened up many minds and will only get bigger.

<br>
<br>
This will lead to the availability to many amazing cannabis products.  It will provide easier access for patients who found the amazing properties to heal or alleviating many symptoms of their illness.  
<br>
<br>

Parents have fled to legal recreational states to save the lives of their child(ren) but only to find themselves locked in a cage.   Once they administer the medicine to their child(ren) they could be sent to jail because their home states deems them as unfit caretakers.  This prop will not only legalize the use of cannabis but also protect our rights to use our medicine.
<br>
<br>

This is where we come in.  We are creating a cookbook called “Herbal Fusion”  that infuses cannabis product with familiar recipes.  There will be a lot of product available to California residents.  Majority are still oblivious on the usage.  With this cookbook, we take out the worries and the mistakes.
<br>
<br>
Parents do not want to see their children inhaling smoke so why not cook with them.  They are learning about their medicine as well as life skills.  This is an alternative to inhaling toxic chemicals from burning and giving medicine at safer proportion.
<br>
<br>

It will allow users to register and create their own recipes that they’ve created with their own photos.  The ability to like/favorite recipes. The user dashboard will entail their recipes they’ve created as well as recipes they favorited.  We want to implement Twilio so the creator of the recipe is notified for any questions or clarifications.  We want to cater to other lifestyles such as known allergies(peanut, gluten, etc…) and vegan.
<br>
<br>

We want to provide a fun responsive UI/UX for the user so we are leaning towards using AngularJS or ReactJS with our Rails on Ruby with PostgreSQL.
